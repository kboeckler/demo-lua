# demo-lua

Here I am trying to get comfortable with lua scripting language

> *Idea*
> Use lua for next AoC

Get ready to 
- include txt input reading
- providing a small return function
    - returning results
    - returning time taken for the calculation

```lua
local util = require("util")
```
